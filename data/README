Unzip a GTFS-compatible zip file into this directory. Then, run the script as so:
./mksql3db.sh DBName.db theGTFSFolder/*.txt

The scripts will produce a database called DBName.db as well as some versioning files.
Transfer the DBName.db file to the /sdcard/Android/data/com.wbrenna.gtfsoffline/files/
folder of the Android device. GTFSOffline will take it from there! Activate the database
in the Settings menu.
