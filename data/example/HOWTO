This is an example of an unzipped GO transit database.
To create a database file, enter this database and run
../mksql3db.sh GO.db *.txt

The database GO.db will be created.
On my computer it took about three minutes - the filtering
and sorting of the data is quite computationally intensive
(to take the work off of the phone!).
