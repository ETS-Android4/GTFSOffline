GTFSOffline
=========================

Description
-------------------------

GTFSOffline is a transit app for Android >= 4.4,
forked from <a href="http://github.com/gdmalet/grtransit">GRTransit</a>,
an excellent transit app for the Grand River Transit bus system.

Because of the standardization of the GTFS feed format, many transit
initiatives across the country are releasing open routes in GTFS format.
This app allows you to download a GTFS zip, process it 


Features

* Flexibility to load as many or as few databases as you want
* 100% completely offline operation

until I get this stable and working properly!
